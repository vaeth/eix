.\" {{{ DESCRIPTION
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
B<update-eix> generates a binary cache from your local portage-tree and overlays.
B<eix> searches this cache for packages that match the criteria you specified.
B<diff-eix> compares two binary caches and finds packages that were added, removed or for
which the highest stable versions has changed.
B<eix-sync> removes the old dep-cache (see B<HISTORY>), runs B<emerge --sync> (or B<emerge --metadata>) and B<update-eix>, it then
compares the new cache with the old cache using B<diff-eix>, while redirecting all output
from B<emerge> and B<update-eix> to I</var/log/eix-sync.log> for cleanliness.

These options are common to all programs in the eix-suite.
.TP

Produce no output on stderr and stdout (fatal errors which occur at the
beginning of execution are printed to stderr, regardless of this option).
.TP
.BR --dump
Show defaults for eixrc-variables.
.TP
.BR -V ", " --version
Print version and exit.
.TP
.BR -n ", " --nocolor
Disables the use of ANSI color codes. This is useful for terminals that do not support ANSI colors.
(This is automatically turned on if stdout is no tty, but can be overridden by using --force-color)
.TP
.BR -F ", " --force-color
The opposite of --nocolor.
.TP
.BR -t ", " --test-non-matching
Before other output, print entries of /etc/portage/package.* which do not
match any existing version in the package database. This option is best
combined with -T to clean up /etc/portage/package.*.

overview in the case of a long list of results, and also to help speed up searching over
slow connections such as a serial console.

Use a verbose layout with additional information about search results such as the license
of a package.

pattern is a wildcard-pattern. See

.\" {{{ OUTPUT
.SH OUTPUT
If you used gentoo for more than a week you're probably going to immediately
recognize the format of the versions-strings. Nevertheless, we are going to
explain them here.
.TP
.BR [P]2.95.3-r8
If a mask for the package was found in the packages-files from your profile, but this
version does not match it, the version is determined to be "masked by profile".
.TP
.BR [M]4.0.0_alpha20050213
The version matches a mask from /etc/portage/package.mask, $PORTDIR/profiles/package.mask
or a package.mask from your profile. Portage calls this "masked by package.mask".
.TP
.BR *3.4.3-r2
That version is "masked by -* keyword".
.TP
.BR !3.3.3
This means the version is "masked by missing keyword".
.TP
.BR -0.8.14
Masked by -ARCH.
.TP
.BR ~3.3.5.20050130
The version would be "masked by ~keyword".
.TP
.BR 3.3.1
.RS
Finally, this would be a stable version.
.\" }}}

.\" {{{ FORMATSTRING
.SH FORMATSTRING
.LP
A formatstring can contain conditional blocks, package properties, colors and
normal strings.

.\" {{{ -------- Conditional blocks
.SS Conditional blocks
Conditions are very simple: A property is expanded and the resulting string is
tested against another string. If they are the same, the condition is true and
the block is executed. Conditions can be negated so that the else-part is
executed if the conditions is true, and the if-part if the condition is false.
The else-part can be also be completely left out.
.TP
.BR { [ ! ] I<VARIABLE> [ = I<STRING>] } I<TCODE> {}
Execute I<TCODE> if the string resulting from expanding I<VARIABLE> is equal to
I<STRING>.
The B<!> would negate the behavior.

.TP
.BR { [ ! ] I<VARIABLE> [ = I<STRING>] } I<TCODE> {else} I<FCODE> {}

I<STRING>.  If it's not, execute I<FCODE>.

printed. If used to print a property, the name B<must be enclosed in square brackets>

.\" {{{ HISTORY
.SH "HISTORY"
.LP
B<eix> was formerly known as B<portagedb>. The name was changed because a part of
portage is also called portagedb, which was a bit confusing for everyone.

The functionality of update-eix was once triggered by using the -u switch on
eix. It was than separated to provide better maintainability. Thus update-eix
came to life.

The new portage-versions (>=2.1_pre1) doen't remove the old dep-cache, thus eix would
always find packages that are not in portage anymore. To circumvent this, eix-sync
deletes the old cache (rm -fr /var/cache/edb/dep/*).
