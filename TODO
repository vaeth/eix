- Finish Russian translation of manpage.

Things to do perhaps:
- Russian translation of --dump (src/eixrc/defaults.cc in ru.po)
- Support DEPEND, RDEPEND, PDEPEND for installed packages.
  (See the comments to the depend, rdepend, pdepend properties in the manpage.)
  Once this is implemented:
- Support searching for differences of DEPEND, RDEPEND, PDEPEND with
  values in installed packages.

Ambitious tasks which will probably not be realized:
- Support for Paludis.
  Would require rather different mask/keywords handling,
  in particular in connected with option -T and with overlays;
  Probably a separated mask handling would have to be implemented to let -T
  still work.  Moreover, overlay handling - especially for /var/db/pkg -
  would have to be completely rewritten and in a way which would probably
  exclude CAREMODE=false and break compatibility with older portage versions
  which did not store repo_name in /var/db/pkg. On the other hand, the current
  implementation of these things is a mess anyway, but even users of new
  portage versions might still have entries without repo_name in /var/db/pkg.
  Moreover, CAREMODE=false is really important for the speed in typical,
  i.e. occasional, usage of eix.
- Full support for USE-Flags.
  Although initial implementation is not
  extremely hard, it would require permanent updates, since frequently
  new and different ways for configuration had been introduced in the
  previous years, and it does not seem that this will ever reach a "final"
  state. So I simply refuse to maintain it.
