- Introduce better shortcuts for the various *DEPEND strings; currently, only
  DEPEND and RDEPEND are recognized if one is a substring of the other.
  Only depend.{cc,h} needs to be modified to improve this - all other logic is
  already there.

- Finish Russian translation of manpage

- Russian translation of --dump (src/eixrc/defaults.cc in ru.po)


Ambitious tasks which will probably not be implemented:

- Support for Paludis
This would require rather different mask/keywords handling,
in particular in connection with option -T and with overlays;
Probably a separated mask handling would have to be implemented to let -T
still work.  Moreover, overlay handling - especially for /var/db/pkg -
would have to be completely rewritten and in a way which would probably
exclude CAREMODE=false and break compatibility with older portage versions
which did not store repo_name in /var/db/pkg. On the other hand, the current
implementation of these things is a mess anyway, but even users of new
portage versions might still have entries without repo_name in /var/db/pkg.
Moreover, CAREMODE=false is really important for the speed in typical,
i.e. occasional, usage of eix.

- Full support for USE-Flags
Although initial implementation is not
extremely hard, it would require permanent updates, since frequently
new and different ways for configuration had been introduced in the
previous years, and it does not seem that this will ever reach a "final"
state. So I simply refuse to maintain it.
