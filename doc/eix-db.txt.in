This article describes the format of the eix index file, usually located at /var/cache/eix. The
format includes a version field in the header_ block. The current version is **@CURRENT@** (@PACKAGE_STRING@).

    :backlinks: none

Overall layout
==============

The file is made up of blocks of data,
which may in turn contain other other blocks. [#vector-vs-blocks]_
The first block is a special header.
The remaining blocks are the categories which in turn contain the package blocks
which contain the version blocks, ...

  .. container:: layout-block  header-block

    Header_

  .. container:: layout-block category-block

    1st Category_

    .. container:: layout-block package-block

      1st Package_ in 1st Category

      .. container:: layout-block version-block

        1st Version_ of this Package

      .. container:: layout-block version-block

        [..]

    .. container:: layout-block package-block

      2nd Package_ in 1st Category

      [..]

  .. container:: layout-block category-block

    2nd Category_

    [..]


.. [#vector-vs-blocks]

  Most blocks here occur as a `vector` (described below), i.e. the
  first entry is the number of elements, followed by the individual elements.
  However, if not stated explicitly that a block is a `vector`, it is
  indicated otherwise in the file how many elements it has.
  For example, the number of category blocks is contained in the header_.

Basic Datatypes
===============

This section covers the datatypes `number` and `vector` (resp. `string`) which are used in the index file.

Number
------

The index file contains non-negative integer values only. The format we use avoids fixed length
integers by encoding the number of bytes into the integer itself. It has a bias towards numbers
smaller than 0xFF, which are encoded into a single byte.

    To determine the number of bytes used, you must first count how often the byte **0xFF** occurs at
    the beginning of the number.
    Let `n` be this count (`n` may be 0). Then, as a rule, there will follow `n+1` bytes that
    contain the actual integer stored in big-endian byte order (highest byte first).

    *But* since it would be impossible to store any number that has a leading 0xFF with this format,
    a leading 0xFF is stored as 0x00. Meaning, if a 0x00 byte follows the last 0xFF, you must
    interpret this byte as 0xFF inside the number.


Examples:

    ==========  ==================================
    Number      Bytes stored in the file
    ==========  ==================================
    0x00        0x00
    0xFE        0xFE
    0xFF        0xFF 0x00
    0x0100      0xFF 0x01 0x00
    0x01FF      0xFF 0x01 0xFF
    0xFEFF      0xFF 0xFE 0xFF
    0xFF00      0xFF 0xFF 0x00 0x00
    0xFF01      0xFF 0xFF 0x00 0x01
    0x010000    0xFF 0xFF 0x01 0x00 0x00
    0xABCDEF    0xFF 0xFF 0xAB 0xCD 0xEF
    0xFFABCD    0xFF 0xFF 0xFF 0x00 0xAB 0xCD
    0x01ABCDEF  0xFF 0xFF 0xFF 0x01 0xAB 0xCD 0xEF
    ==========  ==================================


Vector
------

Vectors (or lists) are extensively used throughout the index file. They are stored as the number_ of
elements, followed by the elements themselves.

====== =====================
Type   Content
====== =====================
Number Number of elements (`n`)
\      1st element
\      ...
\      `n`\th element
====== =====================

String
------

Strings are stored as a vector_ of characters. A trailing '\\0' is not included.


Hash
----

A hash is a vector_ of string_\s.


HashedString
------------

A number_ which is considered as an index in the corresponding hash_;
0 denotes the first string of the hash, 1 the second, ...

HashedWords
-----------

A vector_ of HashedString_\s.
The resulting strings are meant to be concatenated, with spaces as separators.

VersionPart
-----------

A VersionPart consists of two data: a number (referred to as *type*) and a "string_" (referred to as *value*).

The number is encoded in the lower 5 bits of the length-part of the "string_";
of course, the actual length is shifted by the same number of bits.

For the type, these named values are possible:

  ===== =========== ================================
  Value Name        Content of value
  ===== =========== ================================
  0     `garbage`   garbage that was found after any valid version string
  1     `alpha`     number of "_alpha" (may be empty)
  2     `beta`      number of "_beta" (may be empty)
  3     `pre`       number of "_pre" (may be empty)
  4     `rc`        number of "_rc" (may be empty)
  5     `revision`  number of "-r" (may be empty)
  6     `inter_rev` number of inter-revision [#inter-revisions]_
  7     `patch`     number of "_p" (may be empty)
  8     `char`      single character
  9     `primary`   numeric version part
  10    `first`     first numeric version part
  ===== =========== ================================

As an example, we split the version string `1.2c_pre12_alpha-r01.01-foo` like this:

 (first, "1") (primary, "2") (char, "c") (pre, "12") (alpha, "") (revision, "01") (inter_rev, "01") (garbage, "-foo")

To reconstruct a version string, iterate through the vector of parts,
and for each part append a specific prefix and the value stored in the string.
The prefixes you need should be obvious, but here they are listed anyway:

  ========== =================
  Prefix     Name
  ========== =================
  "." (dot)  primary, inter_rev
  "" (empty) first, char, garbage
  "_alpha"   alpha
  "_beta"    beta
  "_pre"     pre
  "_rc"      rc
  "-r"       revision
  "_p"       patch
  ========== =================
