This article describes the format of the XML output
(i.e. with the --xml option) of eix.
The file eix-xml.xsd contains a more accurate description (as an xml-schema).
The current version of the format is @CURRENTXML@ (@PACKAGE_STRING@);
this number occurs in the format itself as the **version** attribute of
the **eixdump** element.

  .. container:: layout-block header-block

   **<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>**

   **<eixdump version="@CURRENTXML@">**

   .. container:: layout-block category-block

     **<category name="** name of 1st category **">**

     .. container:: layout-block package-block

       **<package name="** name of 1st package **">**

         **<description>** ...  **</description>**

         **<homepage>** ... **</homepage>**

         **<licenses>** ... **</licenses>**

         [possibly **<provide>** ... **</provide>**]

       .. container:: layout-block version-block

         **<version id="** 1st version of 1st package **"** [possibly further `version attributes`_ (see below), separated by spaces] **>**

           [possibly `version elements`_ (see below), separated by newlines and tabs]

         **</version>**

       .. container:: layout-block version-block

         [..]

       **</package>**

     .. container:: layout-block package-block

       **<package name="** name of 2nd package of 1st category **">**

       [..]

       **</package>**

     .. container:: layout-block package-block

       [..]

     **</category>**

   .. container:: layout-block category-block

     **<category name="** name of 2nd category **">**

     [..]

     **</category>**

   .. container:: layout-block category-block

     [..]

   **</eixdump>**


`Version Attributes`
--------------------

The following attributes for versions can occur.
Except for id, all of them are optional.

- **id="** [..] **"**

  The full version number (possibly including the revision number).
  Note that id is not necessarily unique for a package, since the same
  version can occur in several overlays.
  Hence, only the triple id/overlay/repository is unique.

- **overlay="** [..] **"**

  The overlay is usually a path.
  However, for virtual overlays this may be different.

- **repository="** [..] **"**

  The repository name is the label of the overlay.
  Usually, each overlay should have such a label stored in profiles/repo_name.

- **slot="** [..] **"**

  The slot name is only output if it is nonempty and different from 0.

- **installed="1"**

  This is only output if the version is installed.

- **installDate="** [..] **"**

  The format of the date is determined by XML_DATE.
  The installDate attribute is output if and only if the installed attribute
  is output, i.e. if and only if the version is installed.


`Version Elements`
------------------

The following elements are used within a version.
Each of them may or may not occur,
depending on the configuration and the version data.

- **<mask type="** [..] **" />**

  Possible values for the type are:

  - **profile**
  - **hard**
  - **package_mask**
  - **keyword**
  - **missing_keyword**
  - **alien_stable**
  - **alien_unstable**
  - **minus_asterisk**
  - **minus_keyword**

- **<unmask type="** [..] **" />**

  This can occur only if the mask element has occurred and describes how the
  package has been unmasked locally. Possible values for the type are:

  - **package_unmask**
  - **package_keywords**

- **<iuse>** [..] **</iuse>**

  Here are the IUSE flags of the ebuild listed (space separated in alphabetical order).
  Only those flags are listed which have no defaults specified in the ebuild.

- **<iuse default="1">** [..] **</iuse>**

  This is like **<iuse>** [..] **</iuse>** but lists only those IUSE flags
  which are enabled by default (i.e. prefixed with "+") in the ebuild.

- **<iuse default="-1">** [..] **</iuse>**

  This is like **<iuse>** [..] **</iuse>** but lists only those IUSE flags
  which are disabled by default (i.e. prefixed with "-") in the ebuild.

- **<use enabled="0">** [..] **</use>**

  For installed versions, this is the list of all USE flags which are
  relevant for the installed version but not enabled during emerge.

- **<use enabled="1">** [..] **</use>**

  As above, but for enabled USE flags.

- **<restrict flag="binchecks" />**
- **<restrict flag="strip" />**
- **<restrict flag="test" />**
- **<restrict flag="userpriv" />**
- **<restrict flag="installsources" />**
- **<restrict flag="fetch" />**
- **<restrict flag="mirror" />**
- **<restrict flag="bindist" />**
- **<properties flag="interactive" />**
- **<properties flag="live" />**
- **<properties flag="virtual" />**
- **<properties flag="set" />**
- **<keywords>** [..] **</keywords>**

  This is the KEYWORDS data of the ebuild.

- **<effective_keywords>** [..] **</effective_keywords>**

  This is the KEYWORDS data of the ebuild, modified by the profile.
