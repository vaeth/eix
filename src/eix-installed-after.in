This is a well-commented demo script for eix (${p}).
It lists packages installed after (or before) the last (or first) install
of the given package/version in an output format which is convenient
as an argument for "emerge -1".
Be aware that only packages in the eix database are considered.

The argument can use shell pattern matching (* and ?; do not forget to quote
them if you call this script from a shell); the first match is chosen.
The :slot part can be omitted if the corresponding package has only one slot.
(Options -l and -L have different rules).
The argument is not needed if option -f, -e or -F is used.

The eix (or environment) variable EIX_INSTALLED_AFTER is prepended to the
arguments; note that this variable is evaluated, so quote properly and be
aware about security risks!

The following options are available:

-i   Ignore all previous options (useful if EIX_INSTALLED_AFTER is set).
-f   Output full list of all packages.
-e TIME Use TIME as "install" date.
     TIME is in seconds since epoch (see e.g. "date +%s")
-F FILE Use the mtime of FILE as the "install" date.
-l   Use /var/log/emerge.log to use the _first_ (instead of the last) install
     time of the given package. In this case, the argument must be a
     regular expression matching category/package-version.
     Note that the time in the log file and the time recorded in the database
     usually differ slightly so that usage/non-usage of option -i need not
     have the expected effect: The package may or may not be included.
     You can use -a/-A to fix the time. Note also that -t or -T have no
     effect on the data in the log file.
-L LOG As -l but use LOG instead of /var/log/emerge.log
-a SEC With -F, -l -L, or -e, increase the actual match time by SEC seconds.
-A SEC With -F, -l -L, or -e, decrease the actual match time by SEC seconds.
-b   Output packages installed before (instead of after) the given package
-I   Include the given package (on the command line) in the output
-S   When finding the starting package, choose the first matching slot
-V   When finding the starting package, look for category/package-version
     instead of category/package:slot
-d   Output the installation date after the package
-s   Output slot of the package, even if there appears no ambiguity
-v   Output category/package-version  instead of category/package[:slot]
-=   Output =category/package-version instead of category/package[:slot]
-t   Use build time (if available) instead of installation time,
     independent of the value of USE_BUILD_TIME
-T   Never use build time'

# Now the main loop. The interesting point is of course the call to eix.
#
# We could define NAMESLOT, NAMEASLOT, NAMEVERSION, and EQNAMEVERSION
# instead of using their default definitions (which are built into eix).
# However, we want to allow that the user overrides these definitions if he
# wants to and thus is able to change the input/output format of this script
# implicitly.
#
# Since there is no corresponding default variable which outputs _only_
# the package category/name (and never the slot), we define such a variable
# for option -S (we have chosen the name NAME for that).
#
# As you can see with "eix --dump", the default definitions of
# NAMESLOT, NAMEASLOT, NAMEVERSION, and EQNAMEVERSION make use of the variable
# VERSION_NEWLINE to output an optional newline.
# We do not want such a newline: In fact, the only newline we want is the one
# which should be output at the end of the LINE variable.
# So we set VERSION_NEWLINE=
#
# We set NOCOLORS to avoid the "reset color string" at the very end.
#
# The name of the variables DATE_FORMAT, DATE_OUTPUT, NAME, and LINE
# could also be any other unused name; it is only important that in LINE
# resp. in the --format argument we use the corresponding variable names.
#
# We have to quote \ for the shell when we use "..." to set variables.
#
# Note that all the following variables are automatically exported, since
# they immediately preceed the command (the \ at the line-ends is crucial):
